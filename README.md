# Hatfield.EnviroData.CVTerms
This repository contains the functionality to initially parse the CV Terms, Definitions and other data located at <a href="vocabulary.odm2.org">this webservice</a> into their corresponding blank ODM2 schema extensions.
In addition, this program will also update the CV schema extension tables when changes to the CV Terms and definitions are made by the ODM2 staff. 

- The data is available in <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/">SKOS</a> and CSV formats
- This program should be triggered by either a WebService, a Windows Service, a Scheduled Task, etc.
